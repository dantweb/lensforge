**Project Name: LensForge Microservice**  
(Short: **LFMS** — LensForge MicroService)  
*“The pluggable Python AI vision core that powers any image-analysis SaaS in minutes.”*

LensForge is your tiny, production-ready Python FastAPI microservice (NN1 safety/quality filter + NN2 domain-specific analysis). It plugs directly into your existing commerce/CRM/billing system via simple REST + webhooks. Swap the NN2 model + prompt template = new “context cluster” (skin screening → genital screening → X-ray → art valuation → anything). Zero frontend, zero storage, zero compliance overhead on your side.

| Rank | Business Model                  | How It Works with LensForge                                                                 | Why Perfect for 0-Paid-Traffic + Min Investment (First 1k Users)                                                                 | Realistic Path to First 1k Paying Subs                                                                 |
|------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | **Freemium PLG** (Product-Led Growth) | Free tier: 5–10 scans/month + basic report<br>Paid: unlimited + PDF export + history + API access | Users try instantly → share results on TikTok/Reddit/Instagram → viral loop. No sales calls. | Landing page “Free AI Mole Checker” or “Free Plant Doctor” → SEO + Reddit/TikTok content → 30–40% convert to paid within 30 days |
| 2    | **Tiered Monthly/Annual Subscription** | Starter $9/mo (50 scans), Pro $29/mo (unlimited + white-label reports), Clinic $99/mo (team + EHR export) | Recurring revenue from day 1. Annual plan gives 2 months free → cash upfront. | Content marketing + community posts → 200–300 free users → 20–25% paid conversion = 1k subs in 4–6 months |
| 3    | **Usage-Based Credits** (Pay-as-you-go) | Buy 100/500/2k credits ($0.05–$0.20 per analysis). Credits never expire. | Zero commitment → perfect for sporadic users (eBay sellers, casual gardeners, one-off patients). | Embed “Buy 100 credits for $9” button in free reports → high impulse upsell. Works great as add-on to freemium. |
| 4    | **White-Label / Embedded Reseller** | Other apps (telemedicine platforms, pet apps, auction sites) embed LensForge under their brand and pay you monthly fee + revenue share. | Your CRM already handles billing → you only provide API key + plugin. Partners bring their own traffic. | Reach out to 50–100 niche SaaS (via LinkedIn/Reddit) offering 30% rev share. 5–10 partners = 300–500 subs fast. |
| 5    | **Plugin Marketplace + Affiliate** | Developers/clinics create & sell context-cluster plugins (e.g., “Art Valuation Pack” $49 one-time). You take 30% cut + affiliate program (20% recurring). | Community builds the ecosystem for free. Affiliates promote for commission. | Open-source the core on GitHub → launch marketplace in month 2 → organic dev + niche influencer growth. |

**Recommended Starter Mix (Month 1–6)**: Freemium + Tiered Subscription + Credits.  
This combo gives immediate cash flow + viral acquisition with < $500 total marketing spend (just domain, Notion landing page, Canva visuals).
