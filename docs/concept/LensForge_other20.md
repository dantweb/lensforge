**Here are 20 fresh, high-potential context clusters for LensForge Microservice** (your tiny Python FastAPI core).  

All of them plug in the **same way**: just drop a new folder `/context_clusters/NAME/` with NN2 model weights + prompt template + JSON schema. NN1 (quality + NSFW filter) stays exactly the same.  

They were chosen for **2026 realities**:  
- Open datasets / fine-tunable models exist on Hugging Face, Roboflow, Kaggle  
- Strong organic virality (TikTok/Reels/Reddit/Facebook groups)  
- Clear edge over GPT-4o/Claude (accuracy, privacy, structured output, integration into your CRM/billing)  
- Low-to-medium regulatory risk for MVP (strong disclaimer + human-review flag)  
- Monetization sweet spot: freemium + €9–29/mo Pro + credits

### Quick Launch Recommendation (Next 6 Months)
**Priority order for fastest 1,000 users**:
1. Mushroom Foraging (#7) — highest virality
2. Sneaker Authentication (#8)
3. Gym Form Coach (#11)

- Privacy-first (no training on user photos)
- Specialized accuracy far above general MLLMs
- One-click integration inside your SaaS

Would you like:
- Full technical spec document (like the dermatology one) for the top 3?
- Landing-page copy + first 10 TikTok scripts for Mushroom or Sneaker cluster?
- Or the exact plugin code skeleton to add any of these?

Just pick one and we ship it. 🚀
